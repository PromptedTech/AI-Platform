## 🎨 **Animation Details**

### **Loading Animation**
```jsx
// Three bouncing dots with staggered timing
<motion.div
  animate={{ scale: [1, 1.2, 1] }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.6, repeat: Infinity, delay: 0 }}
/>
```

### **Typing Effect**
```jsx
// Character-by-character reveal with cursor
const [displayedText, setDisplayedText] = useState('');
// 20ms delay between characters for realistic typing
```

### **Smooth Transitions**
```jsx
// Fade and scale animations for all state changes
initial={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
animate={{ opacity: 1, scale: 1 }}
exit={{ opacity: 0, scale: 0.8 }}
```

## 🚀 **How It Works**

### **Message Flow**
1. **User sends message** → Optimistic UI update
2. **Loading state** → Shows "AI is thinking..." with dots
3. **API response** → Triggers typing animation
4. **Letter-by-letter reveal** → AI message appears character by character
5. **Completion** → Message becomes static with full content

### **State Management**
- `chatLoading`: Controls loading animation
- `isTyping`: Controls typing animation state
- `typingMessage`: Stores the message being typed
- `isTyping` flag on messages: Determines render mode

## ⚙️ **Customization Options**

### **Typing Speed**
```jsx
// In TypingMessage component, adjust this value:
const timer = setTimeout(() => {
  // Lower = faster typing, Higher = slower typing
}, 20); // Current: 20ms per character
```

### **Animation Timing**
```jsx
// Loading dots animation timing
transition={{ duration: 0.6, repeat: Infinity, delay: 0 }}
// Adjust duration for faster/slower bouncing
```

### **Cursor Style**
```jsx
// Typing cursor appearance
<motion.span
  className="inline-block w-2 h-4 bg-primary-500 ml-1"
  animate={{ opacity: [0, 1, 0] }}
  transition={{ duration: 0.8, repeat: Infinity }}
/>
```
